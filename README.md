## Introduction
The **Admin Dashboard** is a practice project focused on mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout design. While it features an aesthetically pleasing design and an intuitive layout, it is not fully responsive and is optimized only for desktop screens. This project serves as a hands-on exercise to experiment with modern CSS techniques and layout management.
